# Code cleaning methods
- remove inline comments from code
- remove HTML tags from Java, JS (so it doesn't have to learn anything extra)
- remove javadoc (or any autogenerated) comments 
- make everything lower case, 
- remove extra whitespace,
- remove empty comments,
- and remove duplicates.
## Data exploration
- check the common length of tokens in both code and comments, and also most common tokens.
- then put a minimum filter and remove outliers by filter by lengths of methods that fall outside of 95th percentile (or any percentile)
## Model training
- using CodeXGlue training [code](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Text/code-to-text/code) (so structure data according to their format)
- takes about 25 mins for training and eval + 25 mins ofr bleu calculation per epoch
# Results
- reached a 97.36 BLEU score on completion of the 2nd epoch.
